My name is Yasen Atanasov (not pictured). 

I'm primarily a game developer, but I also like to dabble in compilers, computer graphics and other stuff. In general I like to solve interesting and hard problems and here try to share how I do it. 

If you have a hard problem, that I can help with you can find me [here](mailto:y.atanasoff@gmail.com).
Also you can take a look at my [github](https://github.com/HypnoBeaverMoose).
