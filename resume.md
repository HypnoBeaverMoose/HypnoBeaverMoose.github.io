## Experience

### Freelance Game Developer 02/2014 - 04/2018
During this period I focused on game development for various clients. Mostly through [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01492cfede161f1deb), but also other channels. There are a number of notable games and projects I worked on:

- [Terraria](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.and.games505.TerrariaPaid&hl=en) - I was hired by dutch studio Codeglue to help out with porting Terraria to mobile devices. The mobile port was done in C++ using the studio's own custom engine.
-  [The Universim](https://store.steampowered.com/app/352720/The_Universim/) - As well as many other developers I had a tenure at Crytivo,  working on the neverending fairytale, that was The Universim. The project was done using Unity3D. I was mostly responsible for new gameplay mechanics, and UI.
- [Rocket Riot](https://store.steampowered.com/app/460190/Rocket_Riot/) - Another project for Codeglue. This time they needed me to bring their game Rocket Riot to XBLA
- [Ivalalearn](https://www.ivalalearn.com/) - An online medical imaging platform design to help veterinary medicine students. Ivala had a plethora of repos (20 - 30) that shared a common base, which was separated in a git submodule. The work involved a lot of Python scripting and git plumbing work. Basically I built a tool in Python to make sure all the projects were up to date whenever the base was changed. Additionally I built a medical imaging viewer using a ray-marching algorithm. All of the projects were implemented in Unity3D.

There are also a number of less notable clients and projects. Overall most of the work was done in Unity, with the occasional C++ project.


### Senior Software Developer 07/2012 - 02/2015
#### [Scopic Software](https://scopicsoftware.com/)
Scopic Software is an outsourcing company, which at the time specialized in computer graphics and web development (an interesting mix). 
While at Scopic I worked for a number of clients, primarily using C++, but also

- UI frameworks like Qt and WinForms,
- Graphics API - OpenGL, DirectX, and CUDA
- Computer Vision libraries such as OpenCV

The more notable clients I worked for during that period:
- [Sketchlist 3D](https://sketchlist.com/) - A woodworking and design application built using Qt and OpenGL. My responsibilities were primarily to maintain the software, implement some new features and refactor the code to improve development velocity and stability.
- [Tomographix Quantiva](https://scopicsoftware.com/portfolio/tomographix-quantiva-workstation/) - Medical imaging application, that employed cutting edge technology to render CT, MRI, etc. The visualization relied on Sparse Voxel Octtrees, which were implemented on the GPU using CUDA. Datasets were streamed directly from HDD to the GPU on demand, whenever the user needed to visualize a particular parht of the dataset.
  - Maintained and improved an existing renderer based on [Sparse Voxel Octtrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_voxel_octree)
  - Worked on image registration and supporting various aspects of the DICOM format.
  - Optimized streaming of data from HDD to GPU. 
  - Implemented image compression using Wavelet Transform.

### Game Developer 11/2011 - 06/2012
#### [Bon Art Studio](https://1050.studio/redirect)

In 2011 Bon Art was a art outsourcing company, that wanter to establish it's own game development of offshoot - [Ludus Studio](https://www.ludusstudio.com/). I was one of their (if not the) first hires.

Worked on three games for the company:
- [Board Defenders](https://www.ludusstudio.com/board-defenders/)
- [Toon Clash Chess](https://www.ludusstudio.com/toon-clash-chess/)
- [Foosball Cup](https://www.ludusstudio.com/foosball-cup/)

"Board Defenders" and "Toon Class Chess" were both developed in Unity 3.5, I was responsible for most of the code and answered directly to the studio head.
"Foosball Cup" was built in an internal engine in C++ and I was responsible for some graphics improvements and gameplay.

## Education

### Masters Degree "Game And Media Technology"
#### [Universiteit Utrecht](https://www.uu.nl/en) 09-2012 - 12-2014 

Utrecht University is one of the leading institutions in Europe in the in the fields of natural sciences and technology. It routinely get's ranked as a top 5 university. 

The program [Game And Media Technology](https://www.uu.nl/en/masters/game-and-media-technology) focuses acquiring knowledge and abilities to do cutting edge research in the fields of computer games, graphics, and multimedia.
Basically, we learned about the stuff, that was going to explode in the next few years.

- Pattern Recognition and Neural Networks
- Computer Vision
- Computer Graphics
- Virtual Reality

My master thesis focused on computer graphics and in particular how to speed up convergence of photon maps using local symmetry in the underlying geometry. You can find it [here](https://studenttheses.uu.nl/handle/20.500.12932/18840) 

### Bachelors Degree Informatics
#### [Sofia University](https://www.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/en)  09-2007 - 07-2011 
A standard computer science course, that covers a wide range of disciplines related to the field. 

- Analytic Geometry
- Linear and Higher Algebra
- Calculus
- Computer Graphics
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Discrete Mathematics
- Numerical Methods
- Object Oriented Programming
- Differential Equations

In general, the programs at Sofia University tend to be a little heavy on the mathematical side, but that's something I learned to appreciate later in life. Turns out its easier to learn Javascript than figure out Fourier transform on your own.
